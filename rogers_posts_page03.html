				<p><img src="./auxi/pix/n810wimax_edition_5000.jpg" alt="Nokia N810 Internet Tablet WiMAX Edition"></p>
<p>In Las Vegas, where the CTIA Wireless 2008 show is going on, Nokia
officially announced its N810 Internet Tablet WiMAX Edition today at
2:00 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p>Because WiMAX signals extend 2-3 miles — as compared to a few
hundred feet for WiFi — WiMAX networks enable broadband internet
connections (2-4 Mbps, with peaks of up to 10 Mbps) for users on the
move.</p>
<p>The device will be “available in the United States during the summer of 2008 in areas where WiMAX connectivity is available.”</p>
<p>Nokia also announced an</p>
<blockquote><p>upgraded OS2008 [that] introduces useful new features to
the platform, including an enhanced e-mail client, support for Chinese
character rendering in the browser and RSS feeds and Seamless Software
Update functionality to eliminate manual software updates, making
periodic updates of the operating system quick and easy. While standard
on the Nokia N810 WiMAX Edition, current owners of Nokia N810 and N800
Internet Tablets with earlier operating systems will be able to upgrade
their device to the revised operating system for free during the second
quarter of 2008.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure if this adds anything to what we already knew about the
next OS release, but since Reggie is having all the fun in Las Vegas,
I’m reduced to reading and re-reading the press release.</p>
<p>Here’s the obligatory statement of significance by an upper-level executive:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By delivering the kind of open Internet experience that
consumers previously only expected on a desktop PC, the Nokia N810
WiMAX Edition is a compelling example of how next generation broadband
wireless technology will not only change the way people think about the
Internet, it will change the very nature of the Internet itself,” said
Ari Virtanen, Vice President of Convergence Products for Nokia. </p>
<p>“Much in the way that the evolution of the fixed Internet from
dial-up to broadband enabled a host of new Internet services and
changed people’s expectations of what an Internet experience should be,
the transition to a broadband Internet experience set free from the
constraints of a fixed network will spark the next wave of new mobile
Internet services, and will forever change the perception of what the
Internet can be.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Ari means the walkaround web is a totally new experience and
the new tablet will be the first to deliver it in this form. No
argument there. (I guess if you’re in one of those WiMAX locations,
we’re talking about the drive-around web, actually.)</p>
<p>Just so there’s no confusion about this new tablet: When not in
range of a WiMAX network, the Nokia N810 WE can also “access the
Internet over Wi-Fi or via conventional cellular data networks by
pairing to a compatible mobile phone via Bluetooth technology.”</p>
<p>Nokia’s press release ambiguously notes that “a number of VoIP and
IM clients are available, including Skype, Google Talk, and Gizmo5,
which can also take advantage of the Nokia N810 WiMAX Edition’s
built-in web cam for video calls.” Whether this statement includes
Skype among the VoIP clients that can make cam calls depends upon how
you parse the sentence. Clarification is already being sought on this. </p>
<p><strong>Added later:</strong></p>
<p>Where will you find WiMAX? Alex Vorn at <a href="http://world-ofgadgets.blogspot.com/2008/04/nokia-n810-grows-wimax-appendage-goth.html" title="Link to World of Gadgets post on Nokia N810 WiMAX">World of Gadgets</a> cites these locales in 2008: Baltimore, Washington DC and Chicago (with Boston “soon” and New York after that).</p>

				<!-- or (function_exists('is_tag') and is_tag()) -->
				<p>I have some computer smarts, but sometimes I’m baffled by the Nokia Internet Tablet.</p>
<p>There are some things I just don’t understand about the tablets (or their OS or the pre-installed apps):</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong style="color: orange;">Why can’t I construct a playlist in the Media player?</strong></em>
<p>You’d think this would be a no-brainer. I just want to grab 5 or 6
of the 80 songs on my N810 and play them together, even though they’re
by different artists on different albums.
</p></li><li><em><strong style="color: orange;">Why isn’t connecting to my PC via Bluetooth really easy?</strong> </em>
<p>Sometimes I’m at my office, where WiFi is verboten. I want the
tablet to use my PC’s direct connection to the internet — I’ve done it
plenty of times laptop-to-laptop in meetings where only one person was
plugged into the wired network. Why isn’t this a snap with the NIT?
</p></li><li><em><strong style="color: orange;">Why is Linux made so hard?</strong></em>
<p>OK, it’s clear that Nokia doesn’t want to support unsophisticated users with all the things that can trip them up in Linux.</p>
<p>But why doesn’t File Manager have a simple switch (Show/Hide) that lets me see the whole contents of my drive? Even with the <a href="http://bonte.co.uk/myBlog/?p=123" title="Link to Mobile Analysis and Development blog">trick of adding a symbolic link</a> to root (or any directory), I still can’t see hidden directories (eg, whose name begins with a dot).</p>
<p>Which leads me to my next question:
</p></li><li><em><strong style="color: orange;">Why can’t I easily add fonts to my tablet and use them in the browser?</strong></em>
<p>Right. I had to make a /home/user/.fonts/ directory and mail myself
a font and then jump through command-line hoops to put a simple font on
my tablet. And go through contortions to tell the browser to use it.
(Except I haven’t succeeded in that yet. Emoticon with amazed look of
disbelief here.)</p>
<p>Might as well ask the real puzzler here:
</p></li><li><em><strong style="color: orange;">Why can’t OS2008 et al just let you be root when you need to?</strong></em>
<p>If us unsophisticates need so much protection against our careless
actions, shouldn’t we be wearing goalie gloves when we handle scissors?
Why isn’t there just a switch that says, “It’s OK. I’ll take the
consequences. Just please let me make a directory or use apt-get
without having to acquire developer-class knowledge.”</p>
<p>Heck. That’s the deep side. But what about the glam cam that arrived with the N800?</p>
</li>
<li><em><strong style="color: orange;">Why isn’t there a face-to-face cam call capability yet?</strong></em>
<p>It’s only the most amazing possible use of this walkaround-web
device — unlimited cam calling via WiFi without having to sit in front
of an anchored webcam.</p>
<p>It’s visual IM — just leave the call connected and talk when you want to talk. It’s IM taken to the next dimension.</p>
<p>Btw, don’t tell me this <em>is</em> here. My wife has the N810 and I
have an N800 loaner from Nokia, and we can’t manage it. It needs to be
click-simple and using Skype.
</p></li><li><em><strong style="color: orange;">Why does upgrading the OS obliterate every manually installed app I’ve put on my tablet?</strong></em>
<p>I know, if I go from Windows XP to Vista (and I haven’t), I’d have
to re-install my apps. But every upgrade and patch in WinXP is managed
without that requirement. Shouldn’t it be possible in this marvelous
Linux world?
</p></li><li><em><strong style="color: orange;">Why can’t the application memory be extended to one of the memory cards?</strong></em>
<p>Is swap the extent of this? You know, I’m willing to risk the
possibility that my flash card will get the same spot written to
100,000 times and fail. </p></li></ul>
<p>Yeah, there are more things I don’t understand about my tablet’s design. Just getting the answers to <strong><em>Why not a model with a keyboard?</em></strong> and <strong><em>How can you call it an internet tablet without handling Flash and YouTube?</em></strong> have really lowered my orneriness. I won’t pick and pick and pick.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s your turn. What behavior or aspect of the Internet Tablet makes no sense at all to you?</p>
<p><strong>Added later:</strong><br>
_______________<br>
* Tablet-to-tablet cam calls via Gizmo apparently arrived during my
recent period of submersion. I’m happy, even if it isn’t Skype. (I
mean: even if the five friends I know with VOIP all use Skype instead
of Gizmo.) Me-to-wife cam-IM is plenty great</p>

				<p>I’m
getting ahead of myself. I’m not actually developing anything for the
Nokia Internet Tablets. I don’t know C or C++ or Python*. (Or Ruby
either for that matter.**)</p>
<p>Still, I’m intrigued by <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=147603&amp;postcount=8" title="Link to post by dont">a reference</a> to <a href="http://pluthon.garage.maemo.org/" title="Link to PluThon at garage.maemo.org">PluThon</a>, which lets you develop Python apps for maemo without requiring Scratchbox.</p>
<p>PluThon is an Eclipse plug-in that allows you to interact with your
N800 or N810 and run/debug your Python app directly on the tablet. You
work in Eclipse, get your usual language support, and SSH the app to
the device from within Eclipse (er, PluThon). And skip the emulation
stage entirely.</p>
<p>Right now, PluThon is Linux-only, but it seems like it could be made to <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=148009&amp;postcount=18" title="Link to another post by dont">work with a Windows setup</a> too.†</p>
<p>Not that I can use it‡. But I can dream, can’t I?</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>* Hey, lucky Java isn’t available on the Internet Tablets or I’d go 0 for 4 on the big ones, eh?</p>
<p>** I have at least made Ruby’s acquaintance. Just barely enough to nod in recognition when we pass in the hallway though.</p>
<p>† And if you want that, why don’t you send a note to eclipse-integration@maemo.org and ask for it. I have.</p>
<p>‡ Hey, what’s to stop an Eclipse-fond Rubyist from doing the same for that language?</p>

				<p>I
think maybe I mistitled the two posts I wrote recently about setting up
a environment for internet tablet software development. No one read
them. And maybe that’s because people don’t realize what they’re about.</p>
<p>The most recent post was called <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/02/24/installing-scratchbox-under-andlinux/" title="Link to 'Installing Scratchbox under andLinux' ">Installing Scratchbox under andlinux</a> and the earlier one was <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/02/23/me-and-linux-round-4-and-a-half/" title="Link to 'Me and Linux' ">Me and Linux, round 4 and a half</a>.</p>
<p>The point of these posts and the thread started by BOFH and <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showpost.php?p=147109&amp;postcount=17" title="Link to useful post about installation">contributed to</a> by OSEmuTech, <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=144045&amp;postcount=1" title="Link to forum thread">Run Linux on top of Windows, without a virtual machine</a>,
is that you don’t have to have a Linux computer — or a dual-boot Linux,
or Linux running on a virtual machine — in order to write and test
applications for the Nokia Internet Tablets.</p>
<p>And that seems to me to be newsworthy.</p>
<p>So I’m repeating myself by posting again, but this time under a more appropriate heading.</p>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> You can easily install <a href="http://andlinux.org/" title="">andLinux</a> on your Windows computer. Took me all of five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> What you don’t get with this (to quote the andLinux FAQ) is:</p>
<ul>
<li>another desktop</li>
<li>the bench of applications that usually ship with Linux distributions (you have to fetch whatever you want)</li>
<li>a printer driver</li>
<li>trouble with further drivers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Point:</strong> You can run Linux apps side-by-side with
your Windows apps, and use the Windows desktop for all the
file-management stuff you already know how to do. And use your Windows
printer drivers.</p>
<p>This is <em>way cool</em>, and I think we should <em>make a big thing of it!</em></p>
<p>Since the internet tablets have an ARM processor (and not an
x86-based cpu the way desktops and laptops do), you need to be able to
write an app for the NIT, see how it looks while you’re on your own
computer, and make a version that will run on a NIT.</p>
<p>So you install Scratchbox and Maemo 4.0.1 to do that. Pete Savage has written a full <a href="http://www.progbox.co.uk/wordpress/?p=453" title="Link to post at silentk::cbx33">step-by-step how-to</a>
that tells you each thing you need to do. Even I, a perennial Linux
tourist (and never a resident), managed it on my first try.</p>
<p>I’m going to repeat myself again: This is <em>way cool!</em> I definitely think we should <em>make a big thing of it!</em></p>

<p><em>Being one man’s continuing quest for happiness despite years of unfulfillment</em></p>
<p>I’ve been using computers a long time (don’t ask) and using
microcomputers long before Microsoft even sold an OS. I was a DOS guy
before I could afford a Macintosh, though I was using Macs at work
starting back in 1985. And I happily benefitted from the Mac’s strength
in desktop publishing software for more than a decade. </p>
<p>When I re-oriented my publishing career towards XML and e-books in
1999, I was forced to be a dual-platform guy. There just weren’t any
XML tools on the Mac, so I bought a cheapo PC and moved back and forth
between my two computers depending on the task.</p>
<p>As I used XML more and my Mac grew ever more gray-bearded, I started
buying new programs for the PC instead of for the Mac. This was a huge
emotional issue. Where the dollars go, there follows the heart (at
least in electronics). Gradually I was transformed from a full-blown
Mac enthusiast (and off-hours tech support for various family members
long-distance) into a full-time WinXP user. It helped that my job now
supplied me with a laptop that I carried from Manhattan office to home
office (where I work two days a week) to out-of-state offices every
week or three.</p>
<p>When the replacement for XP — then known as Longhorn, now as Vista —
first raised its head, I found myself unable to accept the transition.
Microsoft wanted me to pay more for the OS than I thought I should pay
for the computer itself. And forget Apple. That was a company everyone
agreed was the next Polaroid, Xerox and Kodak combined, destined never
to regain financial security or market strength.*</p>
<p><strong>I figured then</strong> that my next OS would be Linux.</p>
<p>I won’t go into my beliefs regarding open software, copyright and
monopolies. Suffice to say that I’m an extremist. Probably many of you
here at ITT have followed the same path towards the sanity of open
software (maybe not as far as I). But that pushed me towards Linux,
too, of course. </p>

I went to some Linux shows in New York. I read articles about software I’d never seen or even heard of that I’d use if I/when I made the switch. I finally met a single person in IT who had experimented with Linux. He didn’t know any more than I did.  </p>

<p>I didn’t actually use Linux till the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet was announced. June 2005.** As before, here was a circumstance where the software I wanted to use existed only on one platform: you couldn’t run the Scratchbox SDK for the 770 except on Linux. And I was dying to get in there and <i>do</i> something.  </p>

<p>For me, at that time, the best approach looked like a Live CD, which would enable me to boot from a CD and transform my work-supplied laptop into a Linux laptop.  More than that, <a href="http://maemo.org/community/wiki/LiveCD/" target="_blank">Matthias Schlenker modified a Knoppix (or Kanotix?) Live CD </a>to include “a pre-built Maemo Environment as well as scratchbox for developing applications.”  </p>

<p><strong>With Matthias’ Maemo Live CD</strong>, I could actually play with the Maemo GUI. (I wasn’t anywhere close to being able to develop an application using it, the rationale for its creation.) And Matthias responded to my requests and included the necessary pieces to build Plucker e-books and read them in the <a href="http://oss.kernelconcepts.de/maemo/plucker.shtml" target="_blank"><u>Maemo port</u></a> made by <a href="http://www.kernelconcepts.de/~nils/" target="_blank">Nils Faerber</a> and <a href="http://www.kernelconcepts.de/~fuchs/" target="_blank">Florian Boor</a> of Kernel Concepts.  </p>

<p>I worked out all the steps to go from Windows to Linux to Scratchbox to Plucker Viewer and also from Windows to Linux to Plucker distiller. I <a href="http://www.teleread.org/blog/2005/07/03/how-to-make-plucker-e-books-for-the-nokia-770/" target="_blank">wrote</a> a (now-defunct: website disappeared!) tutorial explaining how to <a href="http://www.teleread.org/blog/2005/06/29/nokia-770-full-screen-mode-revealed/" target="_blank">make Plucker e-books</a> for the not-yet-released 770. Most of the tutorial dealt with how to make sense of Linux for a non-Linux user like myself.  </p>

<p>I used the Maemo Live CD so much I thought I should take the next step and run Linux from the hard drive.  </p>

<p><strong>I looked at Knoppix.</strong> I looked at SuSE***. I downloaded several LiveCD’s and tried them. And ultimately I settled on Mepis, which seemed to be easier to use and understand than any other distro (a new word in my vocabulary).  </p>

<p>I had a Mepis Live CD, and I donated some small amount to the Mepis cause, and I installed Mepis on my original desktop PC. I embarked then on the process of learning Linux, buying a book and trying to set up an environment that would replace my PC life.  </p>

<p>I never got Scratchbox installed in Mepis, however, and I was really happy with TextPad on the PC and couldn’t bring myself to the task of mastering emacs or vim or any marvelous Linux text editor.  </p>

<p>So I dabbled, but I didn’t catch fire. And eventually I ran into a serious problem on Mepis and was never able to get it resolved. None of the posts I put up at the Mepis forum were ever answered. And the aging desktop Mepis was on seemed slower every time I was on it.  </p>

<p><strong>Around this time</strong> I had to buy another computer for our household (officially it was for the kids to do their homework on, but my wife uses it during the day and in the late-evening).  </p>

<p><i>Aha!</i> &nbsp;I thought. <i>I’ll get a big, big drive and set up a double-boot system.The kids can boot into Windows and I’ll have a proper Linux installation.</i>  </p>

<p>And I did. This time I opted for the combination of ease-of-use, ease-of-installation and active community. That meant Ubuntu.  </p>

<p>So I dug around in the annals of double-booting and got things installed. I wasn’t very happy, however. Even with my years of command-line computing, the guidance was curt to the point of snippiness and no matter what I tried, I could not set the default to be the Windows boot. So on 90 percent of the mornings**** the computer is started up, it has to be monitored until the OS is chosen or else the non-Linuxians end up with a brown Ubuntu login screen and have to go through the lengthy process of shutting Linux down and booting up Windows. And every re-start in Windows the same.   </p>

<p>Gradually the kids’ computer use increased, my wife wanted to spend more time on the web, and it became impossible to get time on this particular computer to learn Linux. So my Ubuntu time shriveled away.  </p>

<p>I have an old HP LaserJet 2100M (the model with PostScript) and my wife wanted it downstairs. So I picked up an adaptor that would connect the laser printer to our network. All the Windows machines were able to print to it easily, but finding a driver and understanding what I needed to do to make files printable from the Ubuntu boot took every ounce of my resourcefulness. I got it to work (and published the information for those coming after me), but I was daunted. This was my fourth microcomputer OS, and I didn’t have the same appreciation for acquiring subtle knowledge known only to the masters. I wanted to <strong><em> use</em></strong>&nbsp;Linux, not <strong><em> master</em></strong>&nbsp;it. With no daily Linux users among my friends or work acquaintances, it looked like I couldn’t have one without the other.  </p>

<p>The only specific goal I set for myself on this computer was to enable it for Cambodian keyboarding and get the desktop version of FBReader to show Cambodian texts. I didn’t succeed.  </p>

<p><strong>Years have passed.</strong> After a very lengthy pre-release gestation, Longhorn has emerged as Vista. Still, I am disinclined to migrate to it. My Linux aspirations have fallen considerably. And yet. With OS2008 on the internet tablets, I want to get a development environment set up to see what I can do with building an e-book browser****.  </p>

<p>So I thought that maybe I would use VMWare to run Ubuntu under Windows. I have done a fair amount of that with Windows on the Mac, and then Mac on Windows.  </p>

<p>I went so far as to download the software and the virtual machine for Ubuntu, but my momentum was so feeble that every possible interruption was sufficient to set aside the install. Never got it going.  </p>

<p><i>Why? </i>&nbsp;I wondered. Well, I think I have an idea now.  </p>

<p>You see, after these three and a half passes at Linux use, I have started once again to climb the uphill path. <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=146523&postcount=11" target="_blank">This post</a> by <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/member.php?u=12627" target="_blank">OSEmuTech</a> in response to <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=144045&postcount=1" target="_blank">a thread</a> started by <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/member.php?u=8114" target="_blank">BOFH</a> concerning <a href="http://www.andlinux.org/" target="_blank">andLinux</a> was what did it.   </p>

<p>One thing I didn’t like about the way I had tried things was I had to be in Linux or in Windows. The best I could manage would be to run them at the same time and switch between them if I needed. And, as I had learned with Mac/PC emulations, switching platforms to get to a different app is distinctly unpleasant. (Even if that’s better than having to quit one and boot into the other.)  </p>

<p>So I was intrigued to learn that andLinux basically lets you run Linux apps while you’re on Windows. You don’t have two desktops: you just have your Windows desktop. It doesn’t install all the Linux versions of every kind of software you use because you use the Windows version you already have if you like it. And you install Linux versions of software you can’t get on Windows or for which the Linux version is better.  </p>

<p><strong>I installed andLinux</strong> this morning. Following OSEmuTech’s footsteps, I’ll be setting up a Scratchbox development environment. (And, yes, OSEmuTech, I will depend on you to get me past any this-could-be-a-showstopper obstacle.)</p>

<p>These days, my favorite editor is XML Copy Editor, with both Windows and Linux versions. I use Firefox, ditto. And Filezilla for FTP (ditto). And Inkscape for vector drawing (ditto). And Pootling for translations (ditto). And 7-Zip for compression. And I’m migrating to Scribus (ditto) for page-layout. I’m dying to dive into FontForge with andLinux (Linux only, although Cygwin makes it usable by PC types). I’m still a Photoshopper (going on 14 years now), but I don’t spend so much time in it these days and GIMP may do the trick. </p>

<p>So maybe as WinXP becomes less and less viable, I’ll be in a situation where I commit wholeheartedly to Linux. Not a dual-boot, but Linux alone. With all these Linux-originated apps in my palette, clearly the transition will be easier now than ever before. (And Textpad has failed to keep up with the times, so that I now rely on it scarcely at all. Not that I like any Linux alternative.) </p>

<p>Maybe with andLinux, I’ll finally catch on to the Linux Zeitgeist I never did before. (And, as always, I’ll share what happens next.) </p>

<p>_______________ </p>

<p>* Little did we know. The iPod’s success has made Apple so much more stable that its computers are selling better than ever. </p>

<p>** Oddly enough, I have no problem remembering the announcement date of May 25, 2005, though I couldn’t tell you the birthdays of two of my brothers and two of my sisters. Maybe it has more significance for me? </p>

<p>With a new device like a Nokia Internet Tablet, a hazy fog of “what do I do?” envelops the break-in period.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do I connect to the router? How do I get the GPS going? How the heck do I build a playlist in this fershlugginer player?</em></strong></p>
<p>Of course, dealing with these questions is one of the main purposes of this website.</p>
<p>But even before you have specific questions, the unfamiliar can
boggle you. Even with my experiences breaking in the 770 and N800, I’ve
been confounded now and then with my new N810.</p>
<p>I think the <a href="http://www.nokiahowto.com/A4686321" title="Link to Nokia N810 how-to's">Nokiahowto.com pages</a>
on the N810 should be put on the device itself. They’re more helpful to
a new user than the help files and the PDF user manual. </p>
<p>Why is that? They’re nothing exotic, merely short, simple animations. I guess it’s a case of <strong><em>show</em></strong> being more helpful than <strong><em>tell</em></strong>.</p>

				<p>When I wrote <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/02/08/the-oblivious-neighbors-a-people-friendly-gps/" title="Link to 'Oblivious neighbors and a people-friendly GPS">last week</a> that we need a people-friendly GPS, I really didn’t have any idea how this might work.</p>
<p>I just know that we need something that works better than the people-unfriendly GPS that we have now.</p>
<p>I have thought about the domain-name registrars and domain-name
servers of the internet — every website gets a specific device-friendly
numeric IP address but people don’t use those numbers. They use the
URI. (Well, think about it: <strong><em>internettablettalk.com</em></strong> is way easier to remember than <strong><em>74.86.202.247</em></strong>).</p>
<p>Why don’t we do the same thing for GPS locations?</p>
<p><strong>Why can’t I</strong> put in a name and have a GPS name server (GPS-NS) look up the specific latitude and longitude the way it works with the web?</p>
<p>OK, it shouldn’t be slavishly the same. I live in Montclair, NJ, and
I would want some parameter to default to “locations near Montclair”
when I put them in. So I could enter “Starbucks” and a star would
appear at 572 Valley Road, without my having to enter
“Starbucks-Montclair-ValleyRoad”. And, yes, Starbucks Corp. would
register the “Starbucks” GPS the same way it registered
“starbucks.com”. And just as that site has a
“starbucks.com/ourcoffees/” page, it could set up the names for each of
its locations.</p>
<p>And, heck, maybe I have to download the GPS-NS table to my device
and update it daily or weekly. Maybe it’s extremely detailed only for a
specified area, not the whole world. So I can put in “Golden Gate
Bridge” or “Sugarloaf” because those are level-1 locations, but not
“Starbucks-Brazil-Rio de Janeiro-Ipanema”. (Unless I say, “Get me
Brazil too.”)</p>
<p>I expect software would let me filter results too, so that if I
entered a name like Xanadu that is used in different states/countries
in different types of business, I’d see only the few possible entries —
the restaurant near me and not the surfboard designer in San Diego, the
clothing store in Milwaukee or the restaurant in Baltimore.</p>
<p><em>Well, just thinking aloud . . .  </em></p>

				<p>As I’ve <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/01/29/nightmare-and-torment-waiting-game-again/" title="Link to 'Nightmare and torment' post">posted before</a>, something went awry when Fedex delivered the N810 I ordered. It never arrived.</p>
<p>After a week, <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=136721&amp;postcount=24" title="Link to forum comment about the persuasion">I persuaded LetsTalk</a> to have Fedex reimburse them for the lost package. They did, and the replacement N810 got here <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=138683&amp;postcount=29" title="Link to the forum comment">Tuesday afternoon</a>.</p>
<p>This morning, a neighbor from another street dropped off the
original and merely mis-delivered package. Like Tuesday’s, this was an
unassuming brown cardboard box about 11″x11″x9″ with nothing blaring
“Fabulous electronics inside!” to alert the unwary (and only a
10-point-type return address indicating the shipper). So eleven days
after receipt, my oblivious neighbors opened the package and only then
realized it wasn’t some low-priority content intended for them, but
someone else’s darling toy.</p>
<p>(Well, that’s what it looks like. I’ve already been asked by one stranger if my N810 is an iPhone.)</p>
<p>So now I’ve got to arrange this baby’s return.</p>
<p><strong>Makes me wonder</strong> — wouldn’t it be
frustration-removing if somehow the shipping could have involved GPS,
with a specific location identified as the drop-off spot? Then I (or
the diligent shipping researcher) could have quickly retraced the
errant deliveryman’s steps and retrieved the original package on day
one.</p>
<p>For that matter, how come we don’t have central GPS reference points that would help locate places? You
know, like <em>“the Empire State Building is at 34th and Fifth, so you go up about fifty blocks to get to the Met”</em> only in GPS terms?</p>
<p>I’ll tell you why, it’s because the numbers are technology- and not
people-friendly: “The Met is at latitude 40.776073 and longitude
-73.964338 and the ESB at latitude 40.75319, longitude -73.985646″ has
too many numbers to allow us to get a handle on the locations.</p>
<p>You know, I already have 1-866-59NOKIA permanently etched in my
memory. (That’s the LetsTalk phone number.) And 1-800-GOFEDEX. See
where I’m going here?</p>
<p><strong>The whole web experience</strong> is built upon the understanding that <strong><em>internettablettalk.com</em></strong> is
way easier to remember than <strong><em>74.86.202.247</em></strong>.</p>
<p>At one end, we’ve got street addresses, at the other latitude and
longitude. What we really need is a friendly GPS, something in the
middle that has a logical structure to it and a way to make the key
pieces stand out without renaming 34th Street “40.750 Way”. Or wait,
maybe I’m wrong about that. Maybe the Empire State Building <em>does</em>
need to be rebranded “750 Empire State” so its universal locator number
is part of its identity. After all, I know how to locate “1010 WINS
News” on the radio because its frequency is part of the brandname.</p>
<p>Then maybe my house would be located by being +50N and -17W from
Montclair’s Central Location Referent (the CLeaR point), and even that
Fedex deliveryman wouldn’t have left my package at +51N-12W without
worrying about whether mine was the house next to <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=135842&amp;postcount=19" title="Link to comment that explains this reference">the blue house</a> or not.</p>
