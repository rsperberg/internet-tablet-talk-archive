				<p>I haven’t held a Nokia N810 Internet Tablet in my hands, but it seems to
                                            me it represents some very astute decisions on the part of the Nokia
                                            team.</p>
                                            <p>The 770 and N800 tablets have the largest, highest-resolution
                                            screens of any device in the pocket-carryaround category. That comes
                                            from an awareness of the high frustration that accompanies surfing the
                                            web on a too-narrow screen.</p>
                                            <p><strong>From day one</strong>, we’ve been asking how can Nokia take advantage of their units’ display advantage?</p>
                                            <p>Well, having used a Nokia-loaner GPS unit for several months, I can
                                            testify that one thing that benefits greatly from a larger,
                                            higher-resolution screen is looking at a map, especially traveling at
                                            65 mph when you can’t spend more than a moment or two glancing at it.</p>
                                            <p>So building in GPS has a surface logic anyone can appreciate. But that’s not what I think is astute.</p>
                                            <p>And adding a keyboard definitely makes it easier for many potential purchasers to accept the device. (As it happens, I don’t have the same urgent desire for finger-typing that impelled my purchase of a Bluetooth keyboard for my 770 in my first months of ownership. But that’s another matter.)</p>
                                            <p>I should add that the cam-calling capability added last January, also has an innocuous plausibility — <em>Won’t you have fun!</em> — that in my opinion masks the truly revolutionary side of the Internet Tablets Nokia is building.</p>
                                            <div align="center">*                *                *</div>
                                            <p><strong>Imagine the GPS</strong> not as a replacement for a car unit, but when on foot as a tourist in a city with a wifi cloud (San Francisco, here we come!).</p>
                                            <p>The device knows just where you are so loads of location-specific information can be delivered to you — historical and tourist info sure, and restaurant- and specific-need info (<em>looking for parking? looking for the closest optometrist to repair your glasses?</em>). We’ve heard about that from the wireless phone companies, looking to extort a comfort tax from the comfortably rich.</p>
                                            <p>But that’s reference material and although bookstores do a big business in such content, so do libraries. People don’t expect to need to pay through the nose for it. So getting it for free from the internet, getting the advertisers compete to pay to get the info to you (the Google model) rather than charging the looker-upper for access, yes, that’s great. Probably be good for Nokia’s purchase of webmap-maker Navteq.</p>
                                            <p><strong>But what if</strong> … the airlines, car rentals and hotel-chain partners of your frequent-flyer program gave you your Nokia tablet with the simple proviso that any time you leave your home region, some GPS data would be posted to them. But not to bombard you with ads (we know that’s the kiss of death for voluntary signup).</p>
                                            <p>No, just so that they could map your actual travels with your use of their services. “Hm-m. Four trips to Chicago, but only flew with us once, only rented our cars twice. Oh, early-morning flights that don’t match up with our departures. Maybe we should look at moving that 7:15 flight to 6:30.” Or: “Maybe we should send a specific offering customized to this user — ‘<em>20 percent off of flights to Chicago</em>.’ We already know he’s going there, we already know he prefers us. Why not get all of his business?”</p>
                                            <p>The GPS model we’ve all seen touted is based on 20th-century marketing — putting your name in front of customers increases sales. (Actually that may be 19th-century marketing.) Yes, there’s a small electronic-era twist — just put your name in front of <em>likely</em> customers — but the truly 21st-century marketer has campaigns designed solely for one customer*. (Think of email you’ve gotten from Amazon that notes “since you purchased book A and looked at book B, we think you might be interested in knowing about book C.”)</p>
                                            <p>In that light, the internet side of the NIT lowers the cost to participate in locational marketing for both company and customer. And the fabulous screen means delivery of much richer content at much lower prices for the advertiser.</p>
                                            <p>Which makes the N810’s Mozilla-based browser and Flash 9 upgrades even more astute.</p>
                                            <p>Hm-m. When my brother-in-law took his family to Rome, they had a guide whom they adored so much they wanted to bring her home. She knew everything, and not just about Rome. What if next year they were to visit, oh, let’s say Florence, and they had a 3-hour web-call with their favorite Italian guide. Who told them to turn the NIT’s webcam around so she could see what they were seeing and tell them about the Duomo and Uffizi and Medici Palace from her office in Rome. Where the call was captured on the travel-service’s computer and edited down to a one-hour video and sent to Atlanta by the time they had returned home. And after touring Florence, the guide connected to her next appointment, showing Paris to some local travelers who wanted the tour in Italian.</p>
                                            <p><strong>We’ve seen outsourcing</strong> that has help desk staffers in one city answering questions from users who work for more than one company, in a multiplicity of locations. A walkaround-web device like the Nokia Internet Tablet, with voice, visual, and computer information (watch this Flash presentation, here’s the webpage, attach the photo of the accident to this email), really does liberate the computer from the desktop (as Ari Jaaksi <a title="Link to the blog, &#39;Telephone -&gt; cell phone; PC -- &gt; 770&#39;" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071123041402/http://jaaksi.blogspot.com/2005/11/telephone-cell-phone-pc-770.html">proclaimed in his blog</a> two years ago).</p>
                                            <p>GPS provides the truly revolutionary NIT with something companies can use to monetize the walkaround web. The keyboard lowers the resistance that some potential users have had to the device. The 10GB card allows the “well, I can use it for music, too” rationalization for those who don’t start with the music player at the center of their electronic life.</p>
                                            <p>And the brilliance of the central design features of the NIT are confirmed once again — small enough to fit in the pocket, really light weight, full-size screen, full OS with the full spectrum of applications available.</p>
                                            <p>I’d say Nokia is doing very well in building out this computing suburb. And who could complain about their development schedule? No one projected a second device as early as it appeared, nor this third. Incredible work and just marvelous follow-up on their original insights. I marvel at the deftness of Nokia’s moves in developing the walkaround web. The N810 is way more remarkable than it’s being given credit for. Maybe it’s masked in the guise of evolutionary add-ons, but I think the N810 is every bit as revolutionary as its predecessors.<br>

                                        <p>Or you can read e-books on your Nokia Internet Tablet using the <a title="Link to FBReader download site" href="http://www.fbreader.org/maemo/">open-source FBReader</a>. <a title="Link to Tiger.com N800 page" href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2817195&amp;Sku=N529-1086&amp;SRCCODE=GOOGLEBASE&amp;CMP=OTC-GOOGLEBASE">Price: $359.</a></p>
                                        <p>David Pogue, the <em>Times’ </em>star technology columnist, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/09/business/09pogue.html?ex=1344312000&amp;en=345f4dcf1bd4dc5e&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">writes about internet radio devices</a>,
                                        single-function handhelds enabling you to listen to music over the
                                        internet without being tethered to a desktop or lugging around a huge
                                        laptop. Prices: Revo Pico $350, Terratec Noxon $330, Roku SoundBridge
                                        Internet Radio $300, and so on.</p>
                                        <p>Or you could listen to the same stations on your NIT. While reading an e-book in FBReader.</p>
                                        <p>The devilishly well-executed iPod seems to have misled everyone into
                                        regarding single-function devices as viable — single-function
                                        e-readers, single-function internet radios. But when you see how poorly
                                        every single-function music carryaround fares compared to the iPod, you
                                        realize that execution — usability, design, stylishness — carried Apple
                                        over the single-function barrier and not that no such barrier exists.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Then there’s the opposite phenomenon:</strong> the companies that treat you like all you want is a phone or PDA and everything operates from there.</p>
                                        <p>Different misconception: that we love every single thing we do being monetized by greedy mega-companies.</p>
                                        <p>In Pogue’s column about internet radio, he points out that it’s so
                                        hard to tolerate commercial radio because of all the commercials.
                                        “These days, it seems as though AM radio has 52 minutes of ads an
                                        hour,” he writes.</p>
                                        <p>So one of the lures of the single-function internet radio device is
                                        simply to restore the balance of pleasure against monetization of
                                        music. <em>The New York Times</em> is preparing to <a title="Link to Reuters news report" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/07/AR2007080700720.html">abandon its Times Select pay service</a> because it has discovered (finally!) that we readers can find just as entertaining writers are all over the web without charge.</p>
                                        <p>If there’s a course to be charted between the Scylla of
                                        single-function and the Charybdis of one-device-for-everything, Nokia
                                        seems to be following it: The internet tablets do several related
                                        things really well, with the form of its devices (no hard disk,
                                        super-high-res screen that’s 800 pixels wide, under 8 ounces)
                                        rigorously matching the real needs while keeping every possible
                                        subsidiary use available (e-books, chess, even spreadsheets and word
                                        processing for goodness’ sake) without charging for it.</p>

				<p>I’m at work and haven’t had opportunity to flash the new OS.</p>
<p>But I read <a title="Link to post in ITT forum" href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=57062&amp;postcount=116">this comment</a> from <a title="Link to TabulaRasa's page at ITT" href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/member.php?u=5728">TabulaRasa</a> in the thread about the new release with Skype and Flash9:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I run Gtalk and open the webcam, the camera shows up within Gtalk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I know there’s a Google Talk plugin for PC’s with a webcam
that allow you to use video and even have video calls with Skype users.
It’s called Festoon. It came out last year, and I have no idea why I
can’t reach the <a title="Link to Festoon (aka Santa Cruz Networks)" href="http://festooninc.com/">festooninc.com</a> website now. Out of business? Bought by somebody bigger? Just a bad day on the internet?</p>
<p>At any rate, maybe someone with the new OS could let us know more
about the interplay between webcam, Google Talk and video calls with
PC’s using a Festooned Google Talk.</p>
<p><strong>Updated:</strong> <em>Read <a title="Link to comment describing cam call" href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=57376&amp;postcount=5">the comments</a> to this post to see that now cam calling </em><strong>is</strong> <em>possible from N800 to N800 with Google Talk</em>.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>          *                 *                 *          </strong></p>
<p><strong>Second update:</strong></p>
<p>After some back-and-forth with <a title="Link to Thoughtfix' blog" href="http://tabletblog.com/">Thoughtfix,</a> I think I understand this a little better now.</p>
<p>We’ve had a cam-call app, and I guess we’ve been able to connect to
other N800’s using either Google Talk or Nokia’s service. And Nokia’s
service was also potentially connecting you to a PC with a webcam.</p>
<p>I don’t know; I never connected to someone with a PC and webcam using Nokia’s invite.</p>
<p>And, gee, I guess the only video internet calls I made were to
people with gmail addresses and they went through Google Talk. But when
people said they were making calls through GTalk, I thought it was
through the IM app — and not the webcam app I’ve been using all along.
(Well, sometimes using. This is a terribly under-utilized feature right
now.)</p>
<p>Once the Skype service adds video, gee, maybe it will be activated
through the Skype app. Or maybe it will use the same app we already
have and use Skype’s network (is that the right word?).</p>
<p>And since I don’t know of any way to get webcams connected through
Google Talk other than from N800 to N800, we’re still on the outside,
waiting to join the larger community of cam callers, while still
participating fully in the walkaround web.</p>

				<p>For
me, the promised addition of Skype to the Nokia N800 Internet Tablet
has meant the ability to connect to millions of Skype users for free
voip calls — a network far larger than Gizmo and Google Talk offer —
and, of course, video internet calls.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ve been missing the boat on this.</p>
<p>A <a title="Link to 'Skype on an N800 caught in the wild' thread" href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?t=7045">forum post</a> here at ITT alerted us to a <a title="Link to jkontherun post, 'Skype on the Nokia N800: it's alive, it's ALIVE!'" href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/2007/06/skype-on-the-no.html">post at jkontherun</a> with a photo of Skype running on the N800 and a few pieces of information: July. No video yet.</p>
<p><em>No cam calls? What’s the point?</em> I thought.</p>
<p>And then I wondered why the photo showed a “Buy Skype credit” link
in the app. You only use that when you pay for Skype calls, which is
only when you’re calling someone who doesn’t have Skype.</p>
<p><em>Yikes!</em></p>
<p>Will I be able to call anyone on any landline or cellphone whatsoever from my Internet Tablet? Looks like it to me.</p>
<p>That, I think, is maybe going to ease my unhappiness at having to wait for Skype cam calls. <em>More </em>than a lot, I should say.</p>
<p><img title="Skype running on the N800" alt="Skype running on the N800" src="./auxi/pix/skype_on_nokia_n800.jpg"></p>
<p><em>(photo from <a title="link to image at jkontherun" href="http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/images/2007/06/27/skype_on_nokia_n800.jpg">jkontherun</a>)</em></p>
<p align="center"><strong>          *          *          *          </strong></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Two days a week I work from home, and I tie up the house phone for an hour at a time with weekly conference calls.</p>
<p>The cellphone reception right where we are (at the bottom of a hill)
is poor, else I’d consider our cellphones as alternate home phones.</p>
<p><strong>In the past,</strong> we’ve had two lines, but we never knew
when we needed the second line and the expense has never seemed
justified. But what a pain it is sometimes having just one phone line.</p>
<p>My “use Skype for a second line” and “well, use Gizmo then” efforts
were abysmal failures. Maybe it was my cheap headset. But things didn’t
work out. And I sure didn’t like being tethered to the upstairs
computer anytime I wanted to make a call.</p>
<p>I realize now that my N800 and 770 aren’t two new phones. They’re two new <em>phone lines</em>.
(Hey, with two children entering precocious years, I might need more
than two additional lines.) Low rates, too — $30/year for unlimited
calling to regular phones on Skype (eg, $2.50/month) and just 1.9 cents
per minute at Gizmo with no minimum monthly.</p>
<p>Could be a very easy way to enable each of us to be able to talk (and wander around the house!) at the same time.</p>

dispenses with a stylus and most buttons, works well ….</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe it’s beginning to sink in that there’s now a category of
devices fitting in-between PDA’s and notebooks. They’re computers, and
they’re something else. (Not <em>every</em>-thing else.) Apple’s iPhone and the Nokia Internet Tablet are just the first, best exemplars.</p>
<p>The iPhone doesn’t have a hard drive or a keyboard. It commits huge
resources to its gorgeous screen and flexible OS. It’s driven largely
by realization that we all want a walkaround web.</p>
<p>Same for the Nokia Internet Tablet.</p>
<p>No, they’re not competitors (except for people’s discretionary
income). What I see, though, is that — different as they are — each
conceptualizes the same insight. That’s why I wrote, back in January,
that <a title="Link to " href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/01/10/how-apples-iphone-validates-the-nokia-internet-tablets/">the iPhone validates the Internet Tablet</a>.</p>
<p>It seems even clearer to me today.</p>

				<p>From
day one of the Internet Tablet era*, I’ve been a believer in the WiFi
path. As broadband has increased its penetration wildly over the last
few years, this has seemed reasonable. And I attribute the failure of
the many Linux tablet predecessors of the Nokia 770 in great part to
having preceded the era of easy-to-use, cheap wireless routers and
widely available broadband.</p>
<p>We’ve entered that era, and if WiFi clouds aren’t covering all the cities as they should, well, that day is coming.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>And yet. “WiFi everywhere” is still an aspiration, not a description.</p>
<p><strong>Last week,</strong> when I was <a title="Link to blog 'Telecom offers one-way video calls, only $120+/yr'" href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/06/19/telecom-offers-one-way-video-calls-only-120yr/">comparing video-over-internet cam calls</a>
to high-priced “video share” cellphone calls, I had to jog myself to
include information that you could in fact use your Nokia Internet
Tablet from anywhere, not just within range of a wireless access point <em>if you connected to the internet through a cellphone data plan</em>.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking wasn’t native. <strong><em>NIT use = WiFi area</em></strong> is how I instinctively thought about it.</p>
<p>But <a title="Link to Ari Jaaksi's blog, 'On line on the road'" href="http://jaaksi.blogspot.com/2005/09/on-line-on-road.html">Ari Jaaksi wrote</a>
about being really really untethered from the desktop way back in
September 2005 when he described his daughter noodling away on his 770
on a car trip, connected to the internet via the Bluetooth phone in his
pocket. And a couple months after that, I got to <a title="Link to 'Surfing on the go' blog" href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2005/12/02/surfing-on-the-go-on-the-road-with-the-nokia-770-and-a-bluetooth-phone/">experience “internet everywhere” firsthand</a> when Nokia lent me a phone and I surfed on the train ride into New York City and then walking downtown to work.</p>
<p><strong>“Internet everywhere”</strong> takes the Internet Tablet to a far higher level of usefulness. It really does.</p>
<p>Still I haven’t treated that as an option. U.S. cellphone data plans
seem to be ridiculously priced, with all kinds of gotcha’s. Apparently
if you level with the telecom rep as to what you intend to do with your
NIT and the cellphone, you’re unambiguously determined to <a title="Link to one example" href="http://www.voipnow.org/2006/07/unlimited_cell_.html">require an $80- or $100-a-month plan</a>. I can’t justify that kind of money, or even half that.</p>
<p>That’s why, in the midst of all today’s <a title="Link to NY Times review, 'The iPhone matches most of its hype'" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/technology/circuits/27pogue.html?ex=1340596800&amp;en=90d00beee782f2be&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">hullabaloo about the iPhone</a>, the datum that leaped out at me was that you’re paying only $20 for an unlimited data plan when you go the iPhone route.**</p>
<p><strong>That’s the first reasonable</strong> price I’ve ever heard of.</p>
<p>When do the rest of us get $20 internet? Why can’t we get it now?
Hey, AT&amp;T, I’ll switch to you tomorrow if you give me the same deal!</p>
<p>__________<br>
*  That would be May 25, 2005. I exaggerate by a couple weeks — I wasn’t a convert till mid-June.<br>
** Not transferrable, not usable by your laptop using the iPhone to
connect to the internet, etc. Reviewer David Pogue says Treo owners at
AT&amp;T are paying about $40 for unlimited Internet.</p>

				<p>AT&amp;T
announced today that it was beginning “Video Share” services in
Atlanta, Dallas and San Antonio, with additional markets to come in
July and eventually rolling out to 50 cities.</p>
<p>Video Share permits the owner of a 3G phone to transmit live video
images to another owner of an AT&amp;T 3G phone in one of the supported
markets. The price is 35 cents a minute, with $5/mo (for 25 minutes)
and $10/mo (for 60 minutes) plans. The Video Share feature is extra and
not part of any AT&amp;T data plan. Only one phone can transmit at a
time, but the direction of the video stream can be switched during the
call.</p>
<p>The size of the video looks to be something around 176 x 150 (or less) pixels*.</p>
<p>Within the 50 cities that will get Video Share, of course you’ll have to stay within the 3G coverage area.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s compare that</strong> to the Nokia N800 Internet Tablet, now and, well, let’s say July.</p>
<p>Right now you can have two-way visual calls — each side transmitting
live — with any other N800 owner. The images are webcam quality, at 176
x 144 pixels. If the soon-to-arrive Skype voip package contains video
as anticipated, cam calls can be made with any of the newer UMPCs —
that is, someone who can walk around with the same untethered approach
of the N800 or a cellphone — and with the millions of computer-based
Skype users with webcams, PC, Mac and Linux. Um, you’ll need to be
within range of a wifi network or else make the call on a cellphone
data plan.</p>
<p>These cam calls are free.</p>
<p>OK, let’s recap.</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T:</strong> Pay $10 every month at a rate of $10 an
hour, for one-way video, and only to other AT&amp;T customers with 3G
phones. Because it’s a cellphone, you can walk around while you talk or
pan the camera. You’ll have to stay within the 3G coverage area.</p>
<p><strong>N800 Internet Tablet:</strong> Free, unlimited, two-way
calls, to anyone with webcam and voip. (You have to use Skype, but you
don’t pay anything to use Skype for these calls.) You and any other
webcammed-tablet user will be able to walk around while you talk or pan
the cam. And you will need to be within range of your wireless network
or with a cellphone connecting to the internet, using your data plan
from your own preferred telecom.</p>
<p>Gee, maybe if the iPhone were being offered with this fabulous deal
I’d spend more time thinking about AT&amp;T’s offer. But, gosh, why
would I want to pay, and pay, and pay for something I shouldn’t have to
pay for? (The day I do that, Apple’s coolness factor will definitely
have rubbed off onto AT&amp;T. Not yet, baby, not yet.)</p>
<p>* As I understand it, the phones use a webcam-type second camera for this video and not the photo camera the phones might have.</p>

				<p>On the one occasion when I got to meet <a title="Link to Ari Jaaksi's blog" href="http://jaaksi.blogspot.com/">Ari Jaaksi</a>, he told me the <a title="Link to blog quoting Ari" href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/02/15/flash-you-can-watch/">goal of the Internet Tablet</a> team was to make the internet experience as good or better on the NIT as on a PC.</p>
<p>We usually talk about the aspects where the Nokia N800 needs to improve.</p>
<p>But what about WiFi reception? The N800 with the most recent OS is
way better at locating and connecting to WiFi than the four laptops I
currently have or have had recent access to.</p>
<p>The new Dell Latitude D820 I’ve been given at work doesn’t
even see our home network (based upstairs) from the dining room. And
something going on with the Comcast broadband or our inexpensive
Netgear wireless router will break the connection to the family
computer downstairs that can’t be resurrected unless the router is
reset. But the N800 (and the 770 I have too) connect just fine after
such singularities (which take place probably three or four times a
week).</p>
<p>Is the Nokia N800 the best device there is for locating and connecting to a wireless network?</p>
<p>I don’t have the experience to say. What can others report?</p>
