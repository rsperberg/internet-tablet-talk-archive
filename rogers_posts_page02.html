				<p>The <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/06/13/mameoorg-logo-contest/" title="Link to Reggie's post on this">maemo.org logo contest</a> that is going on — like others, I received four email messages about it — got me thinking: <em>How do you express the ideas of a community in a name and in a logo?</em></p>
<p>Actually, I mean both “the idea of a community” and “the ideas” of that community when I think about this.</p>
<p>It’s easier when the name helps bind you together — I belong to a
group called FAMCAM - Families with Cambodian Children and you can tell
immediately who wants to belong to this group and why. </p>
<p><em>Maemo</em> is a made-up word and people encountering it form the meaning by what they learn from the encounter. Well, it’s good that <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Task:Maemo_brand" title="Link to maemo wiki about the Maemo brand">a branding process</a>
is going on since what exactly Maemo represented hasn’t always been so
clear — the OS on the Nokia Internet Tablets, the development kit
enabling software for NITs to be developed on a desktop, a Linux distro
that had a Hildon UI overlay to make things run smoothly on a NIT, the
software side of the Nokia effort, the open-source side of the NITS,
the collective effort spurred by Nokia but encompassing individual FOSS
developers, something somewhere in this is what has been meant by
“Maemo” over this time. </p>
<p><strong>Now, “Maemo with a capital M”</strong> is being identified
as an “open source software platform for mobile devices. Developed by
Nokia in collaboration with the Maemo community and some of the best
open source upstream projects.” The Maemo platform is distinguished
from the Maemo SDK and is manifested in numbered Maemo releases. Maemo
Software refers not to applications compatible with Maemo but instead
to the team at Nokia that’s responsible for developing the platform,
SDK and some of those apps.</p>
<p>And the other apps for Maemo? Well, they come from the Maemo
community, of course. And if ever there are going to be any “devices
running Maemo” other than those released by Nokia, then the line
between Nokia’s supportive actions and the community will need to be
clearly demarcated.</p>
<p>And that demarcation is in process now. The logo contest for
maemo.org is one step in separating Nokia’s own use of Maemo from
others’. Now maemo.org will be an expression of the community and not
of the Nokia team. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Hence <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo.org_logo_contest_submissions#rsperberg" title="Link to the logos I've submitted">my logo design</a>:</p>
<p><img src="RogerS%20archive%20at%20Internet%20Tablet%20Talk2_files/maemoorg_logo_contest_rsperberg_6.png" alt="A logo for the Maemo community"></p>
<p>Maemo.org isn’t a company and even the “dot org” is an honorific
rather than recognition that a real organization has existed. But as a
community, it represents the group of people who all contribute toward
the same goal. So in my interpretation of the maemo.org logo, you don’t
get machined results or perfect alignment. Yet it’s precisely this
non-automaton, non-corporate approach that is the essence of Linux and
the FOSS movement and which accounts for its vibrancy. </p>
<p>You can see other expressions of the maemo.org community as a logo at the <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo.org_logo_contest_submissions" title="Link to submissions page">contest submissions page</a> at <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Main_Page" title="Link to maemo.org wiki">wiki.maemo.org</a>.</p>

				<!-- or (function_exists('is_tag') and is_tag()) -->
				<p>I’ve
just had a crisis of convictions — returning my laptop to the
publishing firm I’ve worked for since 2001 meant I needed to buy a
computer quick.</p>
<p>And the deciding point came down to this: <em>How much computing power did I need away from home?</em></p>
<p>You have to know that my friends expect me to separate from them
when boarding the train to New York so I can sit in a laptop-friendly
seat. They’ve also seen me skip a not-yet-full PATH (subway) train on
the next leg into the city and wait five minutes for the next departure
so I can open up the laptop for twelve more minutes of screen time.</p>
<p>Did I truly believe a weblet like the Nokia N810 Internet Tablet would suffice for my mobile computing?</p>
<p><strong>Or has my fervent evangelism</strong> been tainted by
way-cheap access to the Nokeys* I’ve used and by a top-of-the-line
17-inch laptop that my employer nefariously supplied me with, ensured
its constant access by having me work at home two days a week?</p>
<p>Would I spend my suddenly scarce dollars for another laptop,
intending to cart it most everywhere as I’ve been accustomed to for the
last four years?</p>
<p>Or would I buy a sufficiently powerful desktop for less money and rely on my N810 for all my mobile computing?</p>
<p>This from someone who has written well over 90 percent of my ITT
postings on a laptop. Who spends his free time looking at websites in
Khmer (a script not supported by the Nokia weblets) and who works with
multilingual texts every day. Whose eyes are aging and who consequently
has a 14-point minimum font size set in his browser. Who installs on
average one new program a week with a footprint of 30MB to 150MB.</p>
<p><strong>Fabulous as the Nokia Internet Tablets are</strong> for
spontaneous surfing, e-book reading, voip calls**, games, GPS
geocaching, listening to music and watching video***, it’s not a
full-service device. I can’t type 20 words per minutes on its keyboard,
much less 100 wpm (as I do on a full keyboard). Can’t run any topic map
software (needs Java). No great XML and XSLT editors. And so on. How
much would this lack hurt me away from my desktop? Could I manage to do
what I had to do on the run with one or another weblet?**** The
walkaround web is wonderful but what about trips? Could I go days
without a full-powered computer?</p>
<p>Ah, who am I fooling?</p>
<p>I bought the desktop, which was half the price of equivalently
powered laptops. For any kind of on-the-go now, I’m a weblet guy, body
and soul.</p>
<p>__________<br>
* I’ve paid 99 Euros each for the 770, N800 and N810 as they appeared
over these last three years (roughly $115 to $140) as part of Nokia’s
seeding of the weblet development community. An N810 for $140 is a
magnificent machine, there’s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>** I use Gizmo for my second line permanently now. When I’m on one-
and two-hour conference calls, it’s really proved its usefulness by
freeing up the main line for my wife’s calls.</p>
<p>*** TV mostly, via the HAVA player, <em>Today </em>in the kitchen and <em>Charley Rose</em> in bed.</p>
<p>**** OK, at the moment I have five NITs. But some of them I bought
to give to family. Really! I just haven’t gotten around to it.</p>

				<p>My reminders look like this: <em>Michael’s birthday in three days</em> and <em>Time to leave for dentist appt.</em> They’re entered in a calendar app. They’re triggered when I arrive at a particular date or time.</p>

<p>Come on now. We have a full-fledged computer system at our beck and call. <em>Call Jim as soon as you get back from lunch</em> should only activate when I return to work in the lunch timeframe and <em>Pick up milk at grocery</em> only when I’m passing the deli in the evening, on my way home.</p>

<p><strong><em>Why web pads, internet tablets and ultra-mobiles aren’t the same thing</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://jaaksi.blogspot.com/2005/11/telephone-cell-phone-pc-770.html" title="Link to 'Telephone -&gt; cellphone, pc -&gt; 770' "><strong>Ari Jaaksi famously announced</strong></a>
the walkaround web in November 2005 when he pointed out that surfing
wasn’t stationary any more than phone calls were. Cellphones had
untethered calling, and a device like the first Nokia Internet Tablet
meant the internet was available anywhere we were. We didn’t need to go
to a computer in a specific location to get to the web any more than we
needed to find a payphone to make a phone call. </p>
<p>Henceforth, we could carry our web-access with us, the same way we
carry our phones. Ari said it all when he wrote: “I surf in trains, in
cafeterias, at airports, even while driving. I can go online anytime
and anywhere I want.” He called his observations “bold” but they were
in fact revolutionary in understanding how this changes not computing,
not using the web, but how we organize our lives.</p>
<p>Long before I heard of the Nokia 770, I used a small, keyboardless
WiFi-enabled tablet to access the internet from Bryant Park in New York
City. The notion of the web away from the desk antedated Nokia’s
efforts by many years. By my count, it produced at least eight web pads
(the contemporary term) prior to the 770, all of which failed to
establish themselves.</p>
<p>My most complete experience was with the <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT2655123453.html" title="Link to LinuxDevices article, August 2000">Screen Media FreePad</a>,
from a Norwegian outfit. The FreePad had a 10.4-inch screen, 800 x 600
resolution, built-in WiFi and “cordless telephone services”; and it ran
an embedded Linux. No disk drive; if you wanted, you could attach a USB
keyboard.</p>
<p>The rest of FreePad’s hardware was feeble by today’s standards but
practical for 2000. Even back then the group I was working with
expected to buy the FreePad for just $800 (in quantity).[1]</p>
<p>Eight years ago, and only $800. WiFi was in its nascent stages then,
but if you were describing an organization-wide device (as we were) and
not a personal weblet,[2] that probably wasn’t what kept the FreePad
from succeeding.</p>
<p>What did?</p>
<p>Or maybe easier to answer now, from the perspective of time: <strong><em>What is a walkaround-web tablet? What does it look like, what can it do, what is required of it?</em></strong></p>

<p>I’ve tried to identify the critical aspects that explain why a FreePad with its prescient feature set failed to spark a revolution but the Nokia Internet Tablet hasn't faltered.  And sure, the Internet Tablets provide the basic blueprint for my description. But that’s because their development provides the best clues to deciphering this slippery market, the one for ultra-mobiles that Bill Gates expected would have sales of 100 million by 2008.  </p>

<p><b>I think what makes a true walkaround weblet can be reduced to these essentials:</b></p>

<p><font color="Orange">- <b>Shows the full width of a web page</b></font> without scrolling sideways. Regular cellphone screens will never make it.</p>

<p><font color="Orange">- <b>Handles Flash and video</b>.</font> No YouTube, no qualify.</p>

<p><font color="Orange">- <b>Always on</b>.</font> The 770’s cover not only turned off the display and protected the screen, it also broke the WiFi connection. “Instant on” seemed good enough at the time, but today we realize the net needs to be able to reach out and signal us.</p>

<p><font color="Orange">- <b>Pocket size</b>.</font> The original 3-pound, book-size UMPC is like business-gear — it fits in a briefcase but that doesn’t mean it's right at hand when you need it. I say: if you can’t carry the weblet on your person, it’s just a lighter-weight laptop.  </p>

<p>I like to read (and surf) in bed. I’ve found that even the 6-ounce 770 (without cover) is enough to tire my arm if I read or browse too long. Someone else will have to graph iPod and mp3-player and cellphone sizes/weights to identify how little and how lightweight a device needs to be for people to carry it around.</p>

<p><font color="Orange">- <b>Can be used standing up</b>.</font> Or when walking around. Almost a life-changing experience the first time you cross the street and follow a link to a new webpage at the same time.</p>

<p><font color="Orange">- <b>Affordable</b></font> enough to be considered personal electronic devices. Me, I want to pay about $75. We’ll be there soon enough, I expect (actually, the price on eBay for a used 770 is already there). I think the $200 price point is significant for a lot of people, which may be one reason the N800 didn't dip moderately, to $299 or $249, but instead dropped all the way down to the $200-$229 range when the N810 appeared.  </p>

<p>Is the N810 too expensive to be a true walkaround-web device? Not compared to what else is out there. But I don’t think you’re going to see weblet sales in the hundreds of millions (where they belong) at the N810’s current price.</p>

<p><font color="Orange">- <b>Thinks like the web</b>.</font> Maybe that means <i>open</i> not <i>proprietary</i>. Maybe it means <i>hackable</i>, or even <i>encouraged by the maker to be hacked</i>, a la Google Maps. Maybe it means <i>thinks like Google</i>. By that, I mean all of the above and more. The guiding principle is more along the lines of “the more usable the weblet is, the more money we make" instead of "the more we can get you to use our version of things, the easier it is to make money off you.”  </p>

<p>Looking back at the Internet Tablet predecessors and would-be competitors, this requirement forces embedded-Linux devices off the table. Ditto devices with Windows CE/PocketPC as an OS. Maybe even big Windows if the price stays way up there. Really, the lesson of the internet that applies to the walkaround web is that the flow of software and uses has to be unimpeded.   </p>

<p>Even more than that, a Flickr or Facebook or other instant-social-phenomenom has to work on the weblet even easier than anywhere else.  That ain’t so easy — <b><i>works great with what hasn’t been invented yet</i></b> is a pretty steep order. It means devices have to be flexibly designed and quickly incorporate new features (see webcam, GPS). And the new features ought to be stimulating the creation of those suddenly-huge phenomena: Things like voip cam calls or location-based to-do lists, what we used to think of as “killer apps.”</p>

<p><strong>It isn't the hardware</strong></p>

<p>A UMPC like the Sharp Willcom D4 or an OQO obviously come close to meeting these criteria. They will give their users the experience of the walkaround web, but they’re not going to bring it about.[3]  These and a couple generations of UMPC’s and ultra-small laptops seem predicated on the belief that desktop users want desktop power in their carry-everywhere tablet.   </p>

<p>Yes, of course, “faster, smaller, cheaper, more powerful” has driven computing progress since the days of Apple II computers. It’s logical to extend that thinking to web tablets. But I think the walkaround web probably requires two more developments before it is the web we will think of first when we hear the word “internet.”  </p>

<p>The first is <strong><em>connection-ubiquity.</em></strong> Always on really means always on the net. Ari's story about not realizing his daughter was doing the internet thing as they drove on the highway — because her NIT paired silently with the cellphone in his pocket and put her online — meant the walkaround web was real. At least if you worked for a telecom who provided unlimited data calling.  </p>

<p>And WiMAX will bring connection-ubiquity — the drivearound web — to many others. Well at least those living in Baltimore, Washington and Chicago.  </p>

<p>For visual-IMing to shake the ground, you’ll have to be able to reach your friends at any time, wherever they are. If their weblet doesn't answer ... well, you get the picture. Just as email didn't transform our lives until everyone had email, the walkaround web won't fully emerge till we all have it.  </p>

<p>The other development I think must occur is something along the lines of <strong><em>“divergent convergence.”</em></strong> Not the fixed convergence we've seen with every cellphone has a camera, but not unlike what we've seen with the variety of uses on the Internet Tablet. I suspect that the essential precondition for purchasing a weblet is not “just as powerful as your other computer” but instead “fills one of your needs, plus the walkaround web.”   </p>

<p>The “other” need the weblet meets is going to be different for different folks. The Nokia Internet Tablet screen is big and displays maps better than all the original small-screened GPS devices, so I want to use my NIT for GPS too. Or: I like to read e-books, so I want to use my NIT for e-reading and the web. Or: I like to watch movies. Or: I like to play chess (or: other games). Or: I need to be able to read that update in Word/in PDF/in Excel when we go away this weekend. Or: I want to stream music from my PC. Or: I want to draw on a touch-sensitive tablet. Or: I want to program. And so on.  </p>

<p>I’m just naming things we already have, of course. Each of you reading this (and me too) have one or another of these other needs already, and so we have already bought our Nokia walkaround weblet. </p>

<p>Every time I get excited in this blog (such as <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/04/04/transformative-apps-for-the-internet-tablet/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/04/02/crayon-physics-internet-tablets-made-for-each-other/" target="_blank">here</a>), it’s because I see another convergence for yet another group of people.  </p>

<p>And so the walkaround web spreads a little wider.   </p>

				<p>We
all know how hard it is to get release dates out of Nokia — sort of an
extreme version of “ask me no questions, I’ll tell you no lies.”</p>
<p>But it’s even harder to get word of a product’s demise. One day a product shortage is <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/10/20/the-short-happy-life-of-the-nokia-770/" title="Link to post about the demise of the Nokia 770 internet tablet">a sales-finished notice</a>. That’s why this random encounter with an unavailable-in-your-area notice for the Nokia N800 makes me wonder what’s in store.</p>
<p><img src="./auxi/pix/is-this-goodbye800-500.jpg" alt="Nokia N800 internet tablet not available in your area — forever?"></p>
<p>PS: Did I say the unavailable area is <strike>North America</strike> the U.S.? Seems like a pretty big market to run dry in.</p>
<p><strong><em>Added later:</em></strong> Now someone’s posted the info that <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?t=19602&amp;goto=newpost">Dell has discontinued</a> selling the N800.</p>

You might regard the Sharp Willcom D4 UMPC (pictured above) as either a
competitor to Nokia’s N810 Internet Tablet — or maybe as its
next-generation successor.
<p>The D4’s 5-inch screen has 1024×600 resolution: better than the NIT’s 800×480. It comes with 1GB of RAM <i>and</i>
a 40GB drive. WiFi and Bluetooth, of course, slide-down keyboard and
camera. (No GPS) Befitting a next-generation device, the D4 is the
first web tablet utilizing the Atom CPU, Intel’s low-power chip for
mobiles (maybe I should say “speedy chip” — it runs at 1.33GHz).</p>
<p>Yup, the D4 has everything going for it. “Beating Nokia at its own game even,” you might say.</p>
<p>Except the design parameters for a weblet include more than “screen
shows a full web page width.” Light weight — the D4 is twice as heavy
as an N810. Fits in a pocket — the D4 is 1 inch wide and 7.4 inches
long; but maybe Sharp’s customers have bigger pockets than I do.</p>
<p>Well, sure, they’ll need to. <a href="http://geekstuff4u.com/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=&amp;products_id=742" title="Link to D4 page at GeekStuff4U">At $1525</a>, the D4 obviously requires deep pockets.</p>
<p>Me, I’ll be buying weblets in $500 installments — is a D4 worth more than three N810s?</p>
<p>Not to me, anyway, with my small-in-every-way pockets.</p>

				<p>Every
time I mention the Nokia Internet Tablets — on the web or in
conversation — I always describe them as running “a full Debian Linux
(modified to be aware of the hardware keys).” I used to say “virtual
keyboard and hardware keys” but the N810 obviates that.</p>
<p>This passes the truth-in-advertising test, I think. But it’s not one-hundred percent true.</p>
<p>Sure you can take just about any Linux application and compile it so
that you get something that runs on a NIT. This screenshot of the
particularly idiosyncratic font-creation program <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/" title="Link to Fontforge home">Fontforge</a> running on my N810 is proof enough for me. </p>
<p><img src="./auxi/pix/fontforge_outline_editor_500.jpg" alt="Fontforge outline editor on Nokia Internet Tablet"></p>
<p>Even if some apps are slow or not really suited to a tablet, I am
generally tempted to say you can do anything on a NIT that you need to
do on a computer.</p>
<p>Except you can’t print.</p>
<p>Can’t print out that email with the address and time of the meeting.
Can’t print that web page with the neat info. Can’t print out the short
notes entered on the train coming in to work. Can’t print out that
sketch of the new design to hand to your wife.</p>
<p>Supporting every printer imaginable — OK, it’s not something I want
to ask for. I think a “full” Linux ought to, but I’m pragmatic enough
to know that’s a fool’s errand.</p>
<p>It would be nice if some apps could print to a generic inkjet or Postscript device.</p>
<p>See, sometimes I want to surf away from my desk, on the walkaround web.</p>
<p>And sometimes I want to walk around with a piece of paper in my hand.</p>

				<p>Poking around the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/betalabs/audiobooks" title="Link to BetaLabs">Nokia BetaLabs site</a>
recently, I learned about Nokia Audiobooks, which is pretty much just
what you’d expect: Recorded books that you can listen to on your Nokia
S60 phone.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nokia.com/betalabs/audiobooks" title="Link to Nokia Audiobooks page">description</a>
points out that MP3 compression isn’t really suited for voice, and that
using the AMR-WB codec* makes for way smaller files — 5 to 10 times
smaller — that still have “excellent speech quality.”</p>
<p>So you take any audiobook, convert it to the speech-optimal format
with Nokia’s free Audiobook Manager software, and listen to it with
Nokia’s Audiobook Player on the S60.</p>
<p><strong>Why bother?</strong> Well, why waste space? “A typical 400
page novel translates into 10-20 hour long audiobook, which would
traditionally take more than dozen CDs or hundreds of megabytes of
low-quality MP3 files.” Transfer times are faster and storage needs
lower.</p>
<p>Maybe MP3 players will become MP3/AMR-WB players, handling this new
format for on-the-go listening. But, honestly, I’d rather listen to an
audiobook on my internet tablet than my phone.</p>
<p>Me, I don’t like headphones or earbuds, so I really like the NIT’s speakers. I wonder, <em>Why doesn’t Nokia port the Audiobook Player to the tablet? Or adapt the built-in media player to handle AMR-WB?</em></p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense to me. And, well, that’s what I’d like to hear.</p>
<p><strong>ADDED LATER:</strong></p>
<p>Altruist** that he is, <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/member.php?u=9523" title="Link to member profile page">qwerty12</a> (aka fahim) has added the AMR codecs to mplayer. See <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=168003#post168003" title="Link to thread">this thread</a>. Well, there are some hitches (can’t see your amr files in gmplayer to launch them). I’m actually listening to a <a href="http://craphound.com/?p=2021" title="Link to blog at craphound.com">podcast of Cory Doctorow</a> reading the first installment of <em>True Noise</em>, which I converted from an 18.3 MB mp3 file. The amr file is but 6.7 MB.</p>
<p>_______________<br>
* “AMR-WB codec: Nokia Audiobooks uses standardized Adaptive Multi
Rate-WideBand speech encoder (3GPP 26.190 / ITU-T G.722.2 See
www.3GPP.org / www.itu.ch) for audio data compression in order to keep
memory requirement for a book very small while maintaining excellent
speech quality.”</p>
<p>** Doesn’t listen to audiobooks himself but added the codec just because we asked so plaintively!</p>

				<p>I just read a post that I think others would be interested to see. In a <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=137295&amp;postcount=1" title="Link to first post in thread">thread about the MyPaint</a> application, forum member <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/member.php?u=6037" title="Link to MobileDivide's ITT page">MobileDivide</a> <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=164975&amp;postcount=34" title="Link to this post">wrote that</a> “[MyPaint] and Numptyphysics have redefined my tablet use over the last few days.”</p>
<p>I can believe it.</p>
<p>MyPaint is a “small [Hildonized] pressure-sensitive painting application written in python and gtk” by <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/%7Emrenold/mypaint/" title="Link to MyPaint home page">Martin Renold</a> and <a href="http://gudmundson.se/anders_gud/index.php?id=16" title="Link to download page">ported to Maemo</a> by <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/member.php?u=10562" title="Link to Anders' ITT page">Anders Gudmundson</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a couple example drawings done on an N810 in MyPaint by <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/member.php?u=6116" title="Link to Arnim's ITT page">ArnimS</a>:</p>
<p><img src="./auxi/pix/mypaint001.jpg" alt="Drawing by ArnimS"></p>
<p><img src="./auxi/pix/mypain002.jpg" alt="Drawing by ArnimS"></p>
<p>Not the usual kind of thing we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p><a href="http://numptyphysics.garage.maemo.org/" title="Link to Numpty Physics page at garage.maemo.org">Numpty Physics</a> is <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/member.php?u=13654">Tim Edmond</a>’s gravity-physics game using the same <a href="http://www.box2d.org/" title="Link to Box2D webpage">Box2D engine</a>  that <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/04/02/crayon-physics-internet-tablets-made-for-each-other/" title="Link to Crayon Physics and internet tablets, made for each other"> Crayon Physics</a> does.</p>
<p><strong>MyPaint and Numpty Physics</strong> have one thing in common — they let us use the Internet Tablet as a <strong><em>tablet<em></strong>.
Sketching can never be done gracefully with a mouse. Even graphics
tablets — hand on the tablet, eye on the screen — have a disconnect. So
sketching your idea right on the screen — or painting it — is, well,
transformative.</p>
<p>Unlike other graphics programs the IT has seen so far, MyPaint
focuses on brush controls, rather than image-editing, enabling the full
range of styles a pressure-sensitive tablet can capture.</p>
<p>When we talk about the Internet Tablet as being revolutionary or
transformative, it’s because everything in its conception — display,
open platform, size and weight, price — serves to free us from the
constraints our desk/laptops have imposed on us.</p>
<p>So, thanks are due to Martin and Anders and Tim and Erin Catto* for
these specific versions of these great applications. And to the Nokia
seers who conceived the Internet Tablet.</p>

				<p>A couple weeks ago, the <a href="http://svextra.com/blogs/gmsv/" title="Link to GMSV">Good Morning Silicon Valley</a> newsletter posted a link to a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2186848?nav=wp" title="Link to Chris Baker's Gaming post at Slate ">story on Slate</a> (with a devastatingly effective demo on YouTube) of Crayon Physics Deluxe:</p>
<p><a style="left: 425px ! important; top: 0px ! important;" title="Click here to block this object with Adblock Plus" class="abp-objtab-027820805967667384 visible ontop" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/QsTqspnvAaI&amp;hl=en"></a><a style="left: 425px ! important; top: 0px ! important;" title="Click here to block this object with Adblock Plus" class="abp-objtab-027820805967667384 visible ontop" href="http://www.youtube.com/v/QsTqspnvAaI&amp;hl=en"></a><object height="355" width="425">

<p>Petri Puro, the developer, put it together by himself (it bears similarities to some <a href="http://www.vrlab.umu.se/research/phun/">other</a>
gravity-based physics demos/games) and won the “Seamus McNally Grand
Prize — the indie-game equivalent of the Academy Award for best
picture”* — at the recent Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I downloaded the prototype game Puro wrote, <a href="http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/crayon" title="Link to Puro's blog with download of Crayon Physics">Crayon Physics</a>**, and was blown away by it. So was my son, and we ended up fighting over the mouse to solve the last two levels.</p>
<p>Wow! Crayon Physics is just too much fun to describe (stop now and
watch that YouTube demo). OK, Slate comes close: “an ingenious game
that looks like it was designed by a third-grader.” I immediately wrote
Petri Puro and begged him to consider porting Crayon Physics Deluxe to
the Nokia internet tablet.</p>
<p><strong>My real thought</strong> was “Too bad that <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/01/25/a-free-n810/" title="Link to 'A free N810' ">Tim Samoff</a>
already gave that gift N810 away!” I know that once Petri got an
internet tablet in his hands he would realize that the tablet and his
game are meant for each other. </p>
<p>Then a thread was started here in the ITT forums about the game — <a href="http://talk.maemo.com/showthread.php?p=96104&amp;postcount=1" title="Link to ITT thread">I want this game on my N800!</a>. I’m not the only one who sees the need.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody in the Nokia food chain will realize the same thing
when they see Crayon Physics Deluxe demoed and send Petri a tablet.</p>
<p>in the meantime, I’m going to suggest that everyone who thinks likewise write to <a href="mailto:petri.purho@gmail.com">Petri</a> and to anyone they know at Nokia and tell them the same thing: <strong><em>Crayon Physics and internet tablets belong together.</em></strong></p>
<p>Let’s send Petri a tablet!</p>
<p>_______________<br>
* To quote Chris Baker’s original Slate piece.</p>
<p>** Following the precepts of the Experimental Gameplay Project,
namely that the game encompass a single theme (i.e., “gravity,”
“vegetation,” “swarms,” etc), be written by a single person, and be
completed within one week. </p>
<p><strong>Added later:</strong></p>
<p>Visitors to Petri Puho’s blog at <a href="http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/" title="Link to Petri's blog">Kloonigames</a>
can see his other games — he writes one a month and posts them there —
and learn a little about this 24-year-old: “At the moment I’m a student
at Helsinki Polytechnic, studying computer science. Game development
has been a hobby of mine for at least ten years now. My gaming
interests don’t just limit to video games, but also include pen &amp;
paper roleplaying games, strategy games, board games, card games, etc.”</p>
<p>Chris Baker, in his Slate piece, notes that “despite his obvious
talent, Purho isn’t sure he wants to go into the industry after he gets
his computer-science degree. ‘It’s more about writing documents than it
is about designing games,’ he says. ‘And I really hate writing
documents.’” And Baker adds that “Purho will probably have a better
chance of moving the industry forward if he keeps flying solo.”</p>
<p>I think that’s probably true. Now why does that seem so obvious? You
see, I’m not the only one who agrees. To further Petri’s opportunities,
an <strong><em>anonymous benefactor</em></strong> has indicated his
intention to donate a now-idle N800 (yes, made superfluous by his
recently acquiring an N810) to Petri. Shipping to Finland to occur
posthaste. Games, inspiration and <em>possible </em>port to NIT to follow.</p>
